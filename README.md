# V-Autopilot

This is a full self-driving car program, using real-world data to make desisions in real time.
I am planning to use BeamNG.tech as a training platform.
I will use Behavioral Cloning as a training program. This is that training program.
The collected data and the Trained AI will not be open-source.
However, this training algorithm will be open-source, and free to use.

## Dependancies

* `py -m pip install beamngpy`

## Credits:

* **BeamNG.tech** for accepting my application, and allowing me to use your simulator as a testing enviroment.
